Case for internship interviews - fall 2018

We at Novo Nordisk are very excited to work with you this semester! We are excited to see your results! 

Case: Using data, can we confidently conclude that a switch to a cheaper equipment is viable, keeping the same standards of compliance? Using historical data given from 2 specific lanes DK -> Japan and DK -> Canada, determine under what conditions we could dynamically switch the equipment used.
